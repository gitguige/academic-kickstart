abstract: "We formalize and study the problem of optimal allocation strategies for a
(perfect) vaccine in the infinite-dimensional SIS model.


The question may be viewed as a bi-objective minimization problem, where one tries to
minimize simultaneously the cost of the vaccination, and a loss that may be either the
effective reproduction number, or the proportion of the infected population in the
endemic state.


We prove the existence of Pareto optimal strategies, describe the corresponding Pareto
frontier in both cases, and study its convexity and stability properties. We also show
that  vaccinating according to the profile of the endemic state is a critical allocation,
in the sense that, if the initial reproduction number is larger than 1, then  this
vaccination strategy yields an effective reproduction number equal to 1."
